Install Database Tools:\r\n\r\nGive me the command to install prisma, @prisma/client, and ts-node as dev dependencies (use --legacy-peer-deps).\r\n\r\n2. Setup Schema (prisma/schema.prisma):\r\n\r\nInitialize prisma with sqlite if needed.\r\n\r\nDefine these models (use UUID for IDs):\r\n\r\nCategory (id, name, unique name).\r\n\r\nSubCategory (id, name, relation to Category).\r\n\r\nTag (id, name, unique name).\r\n\r\nCourse (id, title, isFree, postDate, relations to Category, SubCategory, and Tags).\r\n\r\n3. Create Seed Script (prisma/seed.ts):\r\n\r\nCreate a robust seed script.\r\n\r\nLogic:\r\n\r\nDelete all records in this order: Course -> SubCategory -> Category -> Tag.\r\n\r\nCreate 5 Categories, each with 3 SubCategories.\r\n\r\nCreate 10 Tags.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Fetch the created Categories and Tags from DB first. Then loop 20 times to create Courses, assigning a random Category, a valid SubCategory from that Category, and random Tags.\r\n\r\nUse strict checks to prevent undefined errors.\r\n\r\n4. Config & Run:\r\n\r\nShow me how to add \"prisma\": { \"seed\": \"ts-node prisma/seed.ts\" } to package.json.\r\n\r\nProvide the commands to run the migration (init) and the seed.",

Setup Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)\n\n1. Initialize Prisma with SQLite:\n   ```sh\n   npx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite\n   ```\n\n2. Update the `prisma/schema.prisma` file with the following schema:\n\n```prisma\ngenerator client {\n  provider = \"prisma-client-js\"\n}\n\ndatasource db {\n  provider = \"sqlite\"\n  url      = \"file:./dev.db\"\n}\n\nmodel Category {\n  id          String       @id @default(uuid())\n  name        String       @unique\n  subCategories SubCategory[]\n  courses     Course[]\n}\n\nmodel SubCategory {\n  id         String   @id @default(uuid())\n  name       String\n  categoryId String\n  category   Category @relation(fields: [categoryId], references: [id])\n  courses    Course[]\n}\n\nmodel Tag {\n  id   String @id @default(uuid())\n  name String @unique\n}\n\nmodel Course {\n  id            String       @id @default(uuid())\n  title         String\n  isFree        Boolean\n  postDate      DateTime\n  categoryId    String\n  category      Category      @relation(fields: [categoryId], references: [id])\n  subCategoryId String\n  subCategory   SubCategory   @relation(fields: [subCategoryId], references: [id])\n  tags          Tag[]         @relation(fields: [], references: [])\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Create Seed Script (`prisma/seed.ts`)\n\nCreate a `prisma/seed.ts` file with the following robust seed script:\n\n```ts\n// filepath: prisma/seed.ts\nimport { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';\n\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient();\n\nasync function main() {\n  // Delete all records in the correct order\n  await prisma.course.deleteMany();\n  await prisma.subCategory.deleteMany();\n  await prisma.category.deleteMany();\n  await prisma.tag.deleteMany();\n\n  // Create Categories and SubCategories\n  const categories = await Promise.all(\n    Array.from({ length: 5 }).map((_, i) =>\n      prisma.category.create({\n        data: {\n          name: `Category ${i + 1}`,\n          subCategories: {\n            create: Array.from({ length: 3 }).map((_, j) => ({\n              name: `SubCategory ${i + 1}-${j + 1}`,\n            })),\n          },\n        },\n        include: { subCategories: true },\n      })\n    )\n  );\n\n  // Create Tags\n  const tags = await Promise.all(\n    Array.from({ length: 10 }).map((_, i) =>\n      prisma.tag.create({\n        data: { name: `Tag ${i + 1}` },\n      })\n    )\n  );\n\n  // Create Courses\n  for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {\n    const randomCategory = categories[Math.floor(Math.random() * categories.length)];\n    const randomSubCategory =\n      randomCategory.subCategories[Math.floor(Math.random() * randomCategory.subCategories.length)];\n    const randomTags = tags.sort(() => 0.5 - Math.random()).slice(0, 3);\n\n    await prisma.course.create({\n      data: {\n        title: `Course ${i + 1}`,\n        isFree: Math.random() > 0.5,\n        postDate: new Date(),\n        categoryId: randomCategory.id,\n        subCategoryId: randomSubCategory.id,\n        tags: {\n          connect: randomTags.map((tag) => ({ id: tag.id })),\n        },\n      },\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nmain()\n  .catch((e) => {\n    console.error(e);\n    process.exit(1);\n  })\n  .finally(async () => {\n    await prisma.$disconnect();\n  });\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Config & Run\n\n1. Add the seed script to `package.json`:\n   ```json\n   // filepath: package.json\n   {\n     \"prisma\": {\n       \"seed\": \"ts-node prisma/seed.ts\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Run the following commands to apply the migration and seed the database:\n\n```sh\n# Create the initial migration\nnpx prisma migrate dev --name init\n\n# Run the seed script\nnpx prisma db seed\n```\n\n---\n\nThis will set up your database, create the schema, and seed it with the required data.",

Backend (Loader):\r\n\r\nFetch all courses using prisma.course.findMany.\r\n\r\nCrucial: You MUST include these relations: category, subCategory, and tags.\r\n\r\nOrder results by createdAt descending (newest first).\r\n\r\nReturn the data as JSON.\r\n\r\n2. Frontend (UI):\r\n\r\nUse useLoaderData to get the courses.\r\n\r\nLayout: Use Tailwind CSS to create a responsive Grid (1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop).\r\n\r\nCard Design:\r\n\r\nTop: Show a badge for 'Free' (Green) or 'Paid' (Blue) and the postDate.\r\n\r\nMiddle: Course Title (bold, truncate if too long) and Category Name (e.g., 'IT / Web Dev').\r\n\r\nBottom: Render tags as small pills/chips.\r\n\r\nEmpty State: Show a friendly message if the courses array is empty.\r\n\r\n3. Type Safety:\r\n\r\nEnsure strict typing for the loader data to avoid TypeScript errors in the view.\n</userRequest>\n"

Fix Type Definitions (CRITICAL):\r\n\r\nThe error causes category, subCategory, and tags to be unrecognized.\r\n\r\nSolution: Define a explicit type helper using Prisma.CourseGetPayload to include the relations.\r\n\r\nExample logic: type CourseWithRelations = Prisma.CourseGetPayload<{ include: { category: true, subCategory: true, tags: true } }>;\r\n\r\nUse this type in the component mapping.\r\n\r\n3.

If it fails, it would likely be due to a mismatch in the Prisma schema or runtime issues with the database.",

Background should be a very light gray (bg-gray-50).\r\n\r\nTypography: Use a professional sans-serif font.\r\n\r\nHeader: Make the 'All Courses' title big, bold, and dark (text-3xl font-extrabold text-gray-900). Add a subtitle underneath.\r\n\r\nCourse Card Design (Important):\r\n\r\nBackground: White (bg-white), with a subtle shadow (shadow-sm).\r\n\r\nHover Effect: On hover, the card should lift up slightly (-translate-y-1) and shadow should increase (shadow-xl). Transition smoothly.\r\n\r\nVisual Hierarchy:\r\n\r\nTop: 'Free' (Green pill) / 'Paid' (Blue pill) badges.\r\n\r\nMiddle: Course Title (Large, Bold) + Category (Smaller, Gray, uppercase tracking-wide).\r\n\r\nBottom: Date (small icon + text) and Tags.\r\n\r\nTags: Style them as nice rounded 'pills' with a light background and colored text (e.g., bg-indigo-50 text-indigo-700).\r\n\r\nLayout: Maintain the responsive grid (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop, 4 col large screens).\r\n\r\nSpacing: Increase padding and gaps to make the UI 'breathe'.\r\n\r\nKeep the loader logic and types exactly the same. Only change the JSX (UI).\n</userRequest>\n"

Backend (Loader Update):\r\n\r\nExtract Query Params: Get search, categoryId, subCategoryId, isFree (yes/no/all), tagId, startDate, endDate, and sort from request.url.\r\n\r\nDynamic Prisma Query: Build a where object dynamically:\r\n\r\nsearch: Filter title contains (mode: 'insensitive').\r\n\r\ncategoryId: Exact match.\r\n\r\nsubCategoryId: Exact match.\r\n\r\nisFree: Convert 'yes' -> true, 'no' -> false.\r\n\r\ntagId: Use tags: { some: { id: tagId } }.\r\n\r\ndateRange: Filter postDate using gte and lte.\r\n\r\nSorting: Handle sort by title, postDate, isFree (asc/desc). Default to postDate desc.\r\n\r\nDropdown Data: Fetch allCategories (include subCategories) and allTags to populate the filter UI. Return them in the loader.\r\n\r\nReturn: courses, allCategories, allTags.\r\n\r\n2. Frontend (UI Update):\r\n\r\nAdd a Filter Section above the grid (use a nice card layout).\r\n\r\nInputs:\r\n\r\nSearch: Text input with icon (Debounce this if possible, or use a Search button).\r\n\r\nCategory: Select box.\r\n\r\nSubCategory: Select box (Only show subCategories belonging to the selected Category. Disable if no Category selected).\r\n\r\nType: Select (All, Free, Paid).\r\n\r\nTag: Select box.\r\n\r\nSort: Select (Newest, Oldest, Title A-Z, Title Z-A).\r\n\r\nInteraction: Use Remix Form and useSubmit. Auto-submit the form whenever a dropdown changes.\r\n\r\nClear Button: A button to reset all filters (link to /courses).\r\n\r\nEmpty State: If filtered results are empty, show 'No matching courses found' and a 'Clear Filters' button.\r\n\r\nImportant: Ensure TypeScript types are updated for the new loader return data. Keep the UI modern/clean as per the previous design.\n</userRequest>\n"

Fix Backend (Critical - Prisma Error):\r\n\r\nThe error Unknown argument mode happens because SQLite does not support mode: 'insensitive'.\r\n\r\nAction: Remove mode: \"insensitive\" from the where clause. Just use { contains: search }.\r\n\r\n2. Improve UI (Make it Professional):\r\n\r\nThe current Filter Bar looks broken and ugly. Redesign it using Tailwind CSS:\r\n\r\nContainer: Use a clean white card with proper shadow (bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-gray-100).\r\n\r\nGrid: Keep the responsive grid layout.\r\n\r\nInputs & Selects: Style them consistently!\r\n\r\nClass: w-full rounded-lg border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 px-4 py-2.5 text-sm focus:border-indigo-500 focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:bg-white transition-colors.\r\n\r\nAdd proper Labels with text-xs font-semibold text-gray-500 uppercase tracking-wider mb-1.\r\n\r\nClear Filter Button: Make it a real button (Outline style), not a text link. Place it nicely aligned.\r\n\r\nSearch Input: Add a magnifying glass icon inside the input (absolute positioning) for a polished look.\r\n\r\n3. Interaction:\r\n\r\nKeep the onChange auto-submit logic, it is fine.\r\n\r\nOverwrite the file with these design and logic fixes.\n</userRequest>\n"

The 'Clear Filters' button does not work.\r\n\r\nPlease OVERWRITE the code in app/routes/courses._index.tsx to fix these Visual & Functional issues immediately:\r\n\r\n1. Fix Input & Select Visibility (High Contrast):\r\n\r\nSTOP using transparent backgrounds or borders.\r\n\r\nEnforce this exact class for ALL Inputs and Selects: w-full bg-white border border-gray-300 text-gray-900 placeholder-gray-500 rounded-md px-4 py-2 shadow-sm focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:border-indigo-500 transition-all\r\n\r\nEnsure the Search Icon is visible (text-gray-400).\r\n\r\n2. Fix 'Clear Filters' Button:\r\n\r\nProblem: It is currently doing nothing or submitting the form.\r\n\r\nFix: Change it to a Remix <Link to=\"/courses\"> component. This is the correct way to reset URL search params in Remix.\r\n\r\nStyle: Make it look like a button: inline-flex items-center justify-center px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 shadow-sm text-sm font-medium rounded-md text-gray-700 bg-white hover:bg-gray-50.\r\n\r\n3. Fix Layout:\r\n\r\nEnsure the Filter Bar is a white card (bg-white) with a visible shadow and rounded corners.\r\n\r\nRetain all Loader and Data logic. Only fix the JSX/CSS.",

Fix Input & Select Visibility (High Contrast):\r\n\r\nSTOP using transparent backgrounds or borders.\r\n\r\nEnforce this exact class for ALL Inputs and Selects: w-full bg-white border border-gray-300 text-gray-900 placeholder-gray-500 rounded-md px-4 py-2 shadow-sm focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:border-indigo-500 transition-all\r\n\r\nEnsure the Search Icon is visible (text-gray-400).\r\n\r\n2. Fix 'Clear Filters' Button:\r\n\r\nProblem: It is currently doing nothing or submitting the form.\r\n\r\nFix: Change it to a Remix <Link to=\"/courses\"> component. This is the correct way to reset URL search params in Remix.\r\n\r\nStyle: Make it look like a button: inline-flex items-center justify-center px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 shadow-sm text-sm font-medium rounded-md text-gray-700 bg-white hover:bg-gray-50.\r\n\r\n3.

Sort Categories (A-Z):\r\n\r\nUpdate prisma.category.findMany:\r\n\r\nAdd orderBy: { name: 'asc' }.\r\n\r\nCrucial: Inside the include: { subCategories: true }, you MUST also sort the subcategories: include: { subCategories: { orderBy: { name: 'asc' } } }.\r\n\r\n2. Sort Tags (A-Z):\r\n\r\nUpdate prisma.tag.findMany:\r\n\r\nAdd orderBy: { name: 'asc' }.\r\n\r\nKeep all other logic (search, filter, pagination preparation) exactly the same.

Polish UI (Match 'Courses List' style):\r\n\r\nLayout: Use bg-gray-50 min-h-screen p-8. Center the form card (max-w-2xl mx-auto).\r\n\r\nCard: bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-gray-100 p-8.\r\n\r\nTypography: Header text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6.

Unlock Title Field:\r\n\r\nRemove the disabled attribute and the bg-gray-100 cursor-not-allowed classes from the Title input.\r\n\r\nMake it a normal, editable text input like the Create page.\r\n\r\nEnsure the action updates the title field in prisma.course.update.\r\n\r\n2. Fix Tags UI (Must match Create Page):\r\n\r\nThe current Tags list is ugly (stacked vertically).\r\n\r\nReplace the Tags section with a Grid Layout:\r\n\r\nUse grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 max-h-48 overflow-y-auto p-1.\r\n\r\nStyle each tag label with flex items-center p-3 border border-gray-200 rounded-md bg-gray-50 hover:bg-white cursor-pointer transition-all.\r\n\r\n3. Sort Tags:\r\n\r\nSort the tags naturally (1, 2, 10) before rendering, just like we did in the Create page.\r\n\r\nOverwrite the file with these fixes.",

Create Modal UI:\r\n\r\nCreate a Modal/Popup that appears when deleteCourseId is not null.\r\n\r\nDesign:\r\n\r\nOverlay: Fixed, black with opacity (bg-black/50), z-index 50.\r\n\r\nCard: Centered, white background, rounded-lg, shadow-xl, p-6, max-w-sm.\r\n\r\nContent: Warning Icon (red), Title \"Delete Course\", Text \"Are you sure? This action cannot be undone.\"\r\n\r\nButtons:\r\n\r\n\"Cancel\" -> sets deleteCourseId(null).\r\n\r\n\"Delete\" -> Submits the form to /courses/{deleteCourseId}/destroy.\r\n\r\n3. Update Delete Button:\r\n\r\nThe Delete button in the Course Card should NO LONGER submit a form directly.\r\n\r\nInstead, onClick -> setDeleteCourseId(course.id).\r\n\r\nOverwrite the file to implement this modern Delete UX.",

Header Section (Show Total Count):\r\n\r\nFind the <h1>All Courses</h1> tag.\r\n\r\nAdd a badge inside the <h1> to show {pagination.totalItems}.\r\n\r\nStyle: inline-flex items-center justify-center px-3 py-1 text-sm font-bold text-indigo-600 bg-indigo-100 rounded-full ml-3.\r\n\r\n2. Course Card (Add Demo Image):\r\n\r\nInside the .map() loop for courses, at the top of the card div.\r\n\r\nInsert an <img> tag before the content wrapper.\r\n\r\nSrc: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516116216624-53e697fedbea?q=80&w=2128&auto=format&fit=crop\r\n\r\nClass: w-full h-40 object-cover rounded-t-lg.\r\n\r\n3.
